		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The bad old native CORBA implementation is replaced with a protocol based on PostgreSQL`s
				frontend-backend (febe) protocol. The new implementation is more easy to develop, it is faster
				and more relyable.
			</li>
			<li>
				Build: maven. The old ant build system was replaced with maven.
			</li>
			<li>
				Default container system: Merlin instead of Phoenix. The Avalon team decided to stop the 
				developement of Phoenix, and go on with merlin. Hopefully Merlin will be soon as fullfeatured as
				phoenix was.
