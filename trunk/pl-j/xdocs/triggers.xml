			<p>Yes, PL-J will soon have support for triggers written entirely 
			in java (or other procedural languages, of course).
			</p>
			<p>
			Unfortunately, triggers have no standardized API, not even java
			triggers, so we are trying to provide all the available solutions
			as API:
			<ul>
				<li>
				PL/Java for PostgreSQL trigger API from Thomas Hallgren.
				</li>
				<li>
				Object or Map based api with typemappers. (PL-J`s prefered solution)
				</li>
			</ul>
			Most databases don`t support triggers written in java, you need to write
			a java UDF, and a traditional trigger calling the java UDF.
