		<section name="Introduction">
			<p>PL-J is a system to run stored procedures and user defined functions (UDF) in
			a relational database management system (RDBMS).
			</p>
			<p>A less exact definition: PL-J is java stored procedures system for PostgreSQL. 
			Even though it is much more than that, people like to simplify.</p>
		</section>
		<section name="">
			<p>
			PL-J is built from reusable/replacable components. We have our
			implementations and the default deployment descriptor, but you
			can write yours if you want.
			</p>
			<subsection name="C - channel">
				The module that knows how to talk to the stored procedure
				system.
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="C - configuration">
				There is a need for a configuration api on the C side for
				channel implementation specific settings (how to communicate
				or even connect to the java side).
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Java - channel">
				The java side channel is responsible for sending and receiving messages
				from the RDBMS.
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Java - type mapper">
				The typemapper is a component that maps raw data into java objects.
				You may use it for custom datatypes too, so you don`t have to worry about
				SQLData in your stored procedures.
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Java - executor">
				Executor components execute object oriented calls.
			</subsection>
		</section>
		<section name="Components">
			<p>
			The following components are implemented:
			</p>
			<subsection name="PostgreSQL call handler">
				The PostgreSQL call handler is the entry point of a stored procedure
				or function from the PostgreSQL ORDBMS. It contains the main logic of
				how messages are handled in a PostgreSQL system.
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="C - FEBE channel">
				The FEBE channel is built from the PostgreSQL groups frontend/backend protocol.
				It contains a modified version of libpq.
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="C - table based configuration implementation">
				The default (and by now the only one) implementation of the C side configuration
				api. It uses a table called 'sqlj.plj_config' to read configuration settings.
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Java - PostgreSQL type mapper">
				Maps PostgreSQL raw data into usual java ojects.
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Java - Java executor">
				The executor that executes java stored procedures written in java.
				It uses a classloader component to load classes, the current implementation
				is file-system based, which will be replaced with JDBC based as soon as
				we have a JDBC implementation.
