			<p>
			You can use stored procedures to implement advanced logic on the
			database level, which can be very usefull in two tier systems.
			</p>
			<p>
			Modern 3 and N tier systems can benefit from stored procedures by
			reducing the number of database interactions. This saves time
			and resources both on application and database server side.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="More advanced logic">
			<p>
			There is a number of tasks a good stored procedure system can 
			fullfill (a few idea):
				<ul>
					<li>Implementing database-independent database links. 
					Integration with message queues.
					This could only work after we could externalize the 
					database`s transactional context to the stored procedure 
					system.
					</li>
					<li>
					We also have an idea to build a completely new and flexible
					stored procedure system using drools, groovy, and BSF. PostgreSQL`s
					class (as table) inheritance option may have also benefits
					for java stored procedure programmers.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="What a stored procedure should not do">
			<p>
				A stored procedure should not:
				<ul>
					<li>Access non-transactional things like filesystems.</li>
					<li>Open a new database session to current database, it is deadlock-prone.</li>
					<li>Perform (or try to perform) transaction operations (commit, rollback, begin)</li>
				</ul>
